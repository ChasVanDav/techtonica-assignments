    <h2>Vanessa's Kimchi Recipe</h2>
    <p>Kimchi, or spicy fermented cabbage, is a food staple in every Korean kitchen. 
        Just before the grueling winter months, Koreans gather as a family and make large batches of Kimchi that last until the spring.
        This gathering is called 'Kimjang,' a tradition passed down for a thousand years.
        Similar to saurkraut or pickles, kimchi is a great tangy accompaniment to any heavy or greasy meal. 
        Since it is a fermented food, it takes some time to prepare. 
        However, it's well worth the wait and I guarantee you'll be making it time and time again.</p>
